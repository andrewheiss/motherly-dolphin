## `r emoji_glue(":person_feeding_baby::dolphin:")`: Note on "motherly dolphin" project name

Because project titles change all the time with revisions, rewriting, and peer review, we used [{codename}](http://svmiller.com/codename/) to generate a [NICKA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._Department_of_Defense_and_partner_code_names)-style internal-to-us project name that wonâ€™t change.

```{r generate-code-name, eval=FALSE}
library(codename)
codename_message()
#> code name generated by {codename} v.0.5.0. R version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14).

codename(seed = "990 rdd trust", type = "nicka")
#> [1] "motherly dolphin"
```
