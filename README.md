## 🧑‍🍼🐬: Note on “motherly dolphin” project name

Because project titles change all the time with revisions, rewriting,
and peer review, we used [{codename}](http://svmiller.com/codename/) to
generate a
[NICKA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._Department_of_Defense_and_partner_code_names)-style
internal-to-us project name that won’t change.

``` r
library(codename)
codename_message()
#> code name generated by {codename} v.0.5.0. R version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14).

codename(seed = "990 rdd trust", type = "nicka")
#> [1] "motherly dolphin"
```
